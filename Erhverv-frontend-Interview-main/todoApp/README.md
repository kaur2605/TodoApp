For this exercise, you have been provided with a bare-bones react app using typescript.

You should use this boilerplate to create a simple To-Do app, with the following features.

- A note should have a title and a description
  - A note may optional have a checkbox to mark it as complete
- A user should be able to create new to-do notes
- A user should be able to remove old to-do notes
- (optional) Write unit tests for your components and logic
 
You may decide the exact manner in which tasks are displayed to the user (e.g. as a list, as cards, etc.)
You may also add more functionality to this app if you wish.

## Tech requirements:

- The app has to be created in react
- The app should be styled using css-in-js if that is unfamiliar to use, then use css-modules. 
- The app has to be developed in typescript
- Do not alter the `tsconfig` file
- Use of [Material UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core) components is encouraged (though not required)

# Optional Exercise: Create a Footer from the provided data

The app you have been provided with has a placeholder footer.
You have also been provided with some [mock data](../jsonBlob.json).

You may use this data to try mimic the footer from TDC.dk. In this task the emphasis is on how you handle the data and map it to components, rather than perfectly imitating the styling.
