# Erhverv-frontend-Interview

Welcome to the technical exercise for your second interview for a position as a Frontend developer at TDC Erhverv.
Please complete as much as you can here. This test will give us something to talk about at your next interview

There are 2 sections in this repository:

1. A small coding task where you should write a function to pass the provided tests
2. A large coding task in two parts:
   1. Write a simple To-Do app with React and Typescript
   2. (Optional) Use the [JSON data](jsonBlob.json) provided data to create a footer which mimics that found on [TDC.dk](https://www.tdc.dk) (structure is more important than style for this exercise)

We will remove your access to this repo on before your interview, so that we may have time to review your work.

---

The details of the tasks are provided in the following files:

[Short Exercise - Clone an Array](cloneArray/README.md)

[Long Exercise - To Do App with TDC footer](todoApp/README.md)

## Working with this Repo

In order to fulfill these tasks, you should make a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) of this repository to work with.

For the questions, you can write your answers in the same document in the space provided.

For the Short Exercise, you have been provided with a placeholder function and test. You should write your code in the `cloneArray` function in `cloneArray/src/cloneArray.ts`. To verify your work, you should open the cloneArray folder in a terminal, and run the `npm run test` command to run the tests. 

For the Long exercise, you can write your code in `todoApp/src/App.tsx`. You may also refactor the code in this app as much as you see fit.

## Submitting

To submit your work, you should open a pull request from your fork to this repository. You should open the PR before 11am on Thursday 25th March, as your access to the Nuuday repository will be removed at that time.
